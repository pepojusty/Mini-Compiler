This mini compiler takes in a simple language and produces the output. This compiler allows for variable definition using the **let** keyword, followed by a variable name. The compiler only allows positive integers to be set to these variables, and that is done by using the **set** keyword, followed by the variable name and an integer. Finally, it can output the variable using the keyword **display**, followed by the variable name.
